# PythonLabActivityAssignVariables

Introduction:
Variables help security analysts to keep track of a variety of security-related information. For
example, analysts may need to create Python variables for the users who are allowed to log in, the
number of login attempts that they’re permitted, and the current number of attempts that a user
has made.
In this lab, you’ll practice assigning values to variables and determining their data types.

Scenario

You are a security analyst who is responsible for writing code that will automate analysis of login
attempts made to a specific device. As the first step, you’ll need to create variables to keep track of
information relevant to the login process. This information includes the device ID, list of approved
usernames, maximum login attempts allowed per user, current login attempts made by a user, and
login status.
Throughout this lab, you’ll assign these variables and check the data types of the variables.
